# Clock Service Demo Impl

## Purpose
I have created this little demo project as an example for a session about Rapid Prototyping and the API-First approach.

The slides for the presentation you can find here: https://sourcefranke.github.io/prototyping-apifirst-session.

## API-First
The REST API has been defined with the help of Swagger.

The Swagger UI is deployed here: https://sourcefranke.github.io/clock-service-demo-api.

## Deployment
This SpringBoot webservice is deployed on the cloud plattform [Heroku](https://heroku.com).
